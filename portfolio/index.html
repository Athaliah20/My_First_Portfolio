            <h3>Project 1: Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
            <p>
                I created a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills,
                projects, and experience. The website is built using HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript, and it features a responsive design to ensure
                it looks great on all devices.

            <h3>Project 2: Task Management App</h3>
            <p>
                I developed a task management application to help users organize
                their daily tasks and improve productivity. The app is built
                using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with
                a MongoDB database to store user data.
